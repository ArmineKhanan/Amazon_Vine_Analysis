# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Our task within the current project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.
### Methodology
In this project, youâ€™ll have access to approximately 50 datasetsone of which should be picked to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. For the second part of the project we will use PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. 

## Results
### ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
